<p>Please take a moment to read the information about our organization below and then please make a donation.</p>

<p>WeCare.org is a nonprofit organization and we need your help to continue operations and to fund our programs.</p>


<p>
WeCare.org conducts extensive work online and offline to further its mission of substance abuse prevention, awareness, and support. In addition to operating WeCare.org, which we believe is going to be one of the most visited site in Zimbabwe, we intent to assist many individuals via this website. And we intent to constantly develop new sites to address other social issues.</p>

<p>In addition to assisting single mothers and individuals with substance abuse problems we intend to diversify our service to be available to other groups of the Zimbabwean community who may be facing challenges in their daily lives.</p>

<p>We also intent to run an online substance- abuse survivors' forum and a single- mother forum, respectively, which will provide a safe place for drug abuse survivors amd single mothers to receive help.</p>



<p>And we work to spread awareness about drug abuse in as many ways as possible.</p>

<p>And we are constantly expanding our online work in every way that we can so we may better assist substance- abuse survivors, single mothers and others who need our help.</p>

<p>Offline, we give presentations about substance abuse, run substance- abuse awareness campaigns, help schools establish effective substance-abuse prevention and anti-bullying strategies, visit and call substance-abuse survivors, and assist individuals with addiction problems.</p>

<p>We also work extensively with the press, responding to numerous press inquiries and providing them with interviews, which helps us educate the press, and ultimately the general public, about substance abuse.</p>

<p>Future plans include expanding our online and offline work, launching more substance  awareness campaingns and events, training more people, assisting more schools with substance abuse prevention and anti-bullying strategies, producing DVDs, CDs, pamphlets, booklets, and other materials, establishing substance abuse prevention training programs, developing more programs for substance abuse survivors, and increasing the number of people involved with the organization, among other things!</p>

<p>And we are ALWAYS improving and expanding our work because it is literally a matter of life or death for the countless people we serve.</p>

<p>Please help us on our mission of substance abuse prevention, awareness, and support by making a donation today.</p>

<p>All donations are welcome and no donation is too small or too large. Every donation counts!</p>
