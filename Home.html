								<h3>having trouble dealing with drugs and alcohol?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>It is  not practically possible to prevent people from taking drugs, but we can all take practial steps to help others, whether they are friends, family members, workmates or neighbours to stop substance abuse. By sharing this piece of information with others, we can all help somebody to avoid drug abuse or help somebody to stop indulging in drugs altogether. Substance abuse is partcularly rife in teenage youth and can negatively affect their education, careers and even relationships if left unaddressed. substance abuse comes in many forms: alcohol abuse; marijuana; sniffing glue; illicit drugs like broncleer etc. </p>

								<h3>Suicide is not an answer</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Many people who are deeply depressed have difficulty realizing that their life will eventually get better. Whether itâ€™s from a scientific breakthrough involving a new treatment for their condition or something as simple as making a new friend, we can recover from feelings of depression and pain. If you commit suicide, you eliminate all hope for the future and you eliminate the chance to find enjoyment in life.</p>
